# Data Science for Business Project
Machine learning project for the course "Data Science for Business" at Dauphine-PSL University (academic year 2022-2023).

## Regression : build full ML methodology to predict Auto Insurance pricing 
**Problem statement** :
In the context of price optimization, we need to inject in the demand
model a variable that reflects competitiveness. Fortunately we have at 
disposal a market index price on a set of quotes. We donâ€™t know the 
details on this index (it could be the best price offer, or any kinds of 
averaged price offer), but we know it is useful to segment elasticity.

**Extension exercise** :  perform an interpretability study 

## Clustering : build three clustering methodologies on credit bank data
**Perform a clustering within three methods** : 
  * Get dummies+KMEANS
  * FAMD+KMEANS
  * PCA+MCA+KMEANS
